do creditcard validation later using OnlyOnePreferentialCreditCard
finish updates and start development on the next assignment as quickly as possible

Create a Admin control panel page, with the CRUDs
then, create a button thats like "See client-only pages" and show the list of clients, make the admin choose one of the clients
to navigate the client-only pages as a specific client (that way, we dont need to have authentication)

addressing fields in client forms are NOT using the correct special character regex (they are excluding accent characters like à^õ)

stock should have a LocalDate and not LocalDateTime probably

add expiry date for promotionalCoupons and later exchange (troca) coupons

add check to see if the client is in a buying page, and if it is, dont let the cart expire

// bugs to fix

-> promotional coupon infinite discount // apparently fixed lol
-> sale page not showing total price // fixed
-> DTO of product not loading image or date // loading date, will have to fix image later
-> inactivation reason for product creation page doesnt appear by default (make the input checked by default) // fixed
-> cant use decimals in width, height length in product and productDTO due to float type apparently // fixed
-> 0 default value in product fields

// validations to do

-> CurrentPasswordCorrect (the current password passed in the form must be equal the actual current password)
-> ProductNameCantBeUsedByMultipleProducts (cant have the same name in multiple products)

-> CantOrderProductWithNoStock (cant order product with 0 stock)
-> CantOrderProductExceedingStock (cant order an amount of product higher than its stock)

-> CantPayLessThanTenReaisWithoutCoupon (each card cant pay less than 10 reais without coupon)
-> PaymentEqualToPurchaseAmount (the payment of the sale must be equal to the amount required, not more, not less)

// leave the validations for later

// things to add
-> Button to delete address and creditcard after solving issue
-> Update and create address and creditcard must be able to returnto the client profile

// known massive bugs:

//// cant delete credit card and address if it already has been used to make an order and buy something (coupling issue)
